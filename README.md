viral metagenomics pipeline

The sequence of scripts represents a partially-complete adaptation of the metagenomics pipeline developed by the Metagenome Project at the DOE Joint Genome Institute. Helper scripts run supporting software.

Our team did shift to another pipeline after finding that our contigs were too short for this one.
